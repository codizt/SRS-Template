# **Substio** - SRS
A subscription and event management platform for content creators.

<br/> 

## Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Substio** is a Subscription Management Service aimed to bridge the gap between content creators and content consumers. We're currently facing a huge surge in the online tutorials and I believe there are a lot more people out there who want to make money by teaching people what they know well. But limited exposure and the complexities of maintaining the pupils keeps many from starting out. In a similar way tons of consumers are looking for the tutorials but hardly find any good ones and even then find it to be too costly at times. Some may argue there are platforms like Udemy and SkillShare where they can pay and learn. While that may be true, we must agree that the effectiveness of live classes are far more than that of prerecorded videos. We are also using Google Calendar and Google Meet as a way to send the schedule to the members in the simplest way possible and take live online classes.
